Birth date: March 07, 2017. Happy Birthday! :)


MANIFESTO:

With LifeOS, we create worlds of living digital organisms. Nothing is stopping us but ourselves, as we build our busy worlds on our machines, they spring into life and grow and evolve into wonderful new forms! :)

We work to create fun, beautiful, useful creatures out of binary digits.

Join us!


COMPONENTS:

To start, LifeOS includes a system running on various computer platforms, with a user interface (the HUD), and a zone for the evolving creatures.
